# Activation

The plugin gets activated when .scss / .sass files are opened.


More details of the plugin can be found at [vscode-dartsass Page](https://codelios.github.io/vscode-dartsass/).

# Properties

This extension contributes the following properties:

## `dartsass.disableAutoPrefixer`

Default: false. Disables postcss processing using autoprefixer library.

## `dartsass.disableSourceMap`

Default: False. Flag to disable source maps file generation (*.map). Source Maps are generated by default though.

## `dartsass.disableCompileOnSave`

Default: False. This disables a compilation with every save.

## `dartsass.enableStartWithUnderscores`

Default: false. Enables compilation of files that start with underscores.

## `dartsass.includePath`
  Default: [ ]. Set of directories to be specified as includePath for sass compilation. <b>Important:</b> Currently we do not support spaces in `includePath` given the quirks associated with that. So ensure that you do not have spaces in the same.


## `dartsass.nodeExePath`

Default: `node.exe`. Sets the PATH to the node.exe executable.

Important: This property is applicable on the windows platform only. On Linux, this property is completely ignored and not used at all

## `dartsass.execPlatform`

Default: `host`. Property to mention the execution platform of the dart sass plugin.

For the most part , this plugin attribute is best left untouched. In case when you are working on a Windows host but remotely editing files on the Linux platform, then changing this option is helpful.

Possible values:

* `host`: Sass source files are compiled on the samae platform as that of the vscode editor
* `linux`: Sass source files are compiled on the linux platform and accessed possibly but not necessarily from a windows host.
* `windows`: Sass source files are compiled on the windows platform and accessed possibly but not necessarily from a windows host.

**Important: This property is experimental and not guaranteed to work though.**

## `dartsass.outputFormat`

Default: `both`. Property to customize the format of the output files, generated by the scss compiler.

Possible values:

* `cssonly`: Generetes only the compiled css file and not the minified file
* `minified`: Generates only the minified css file and not the compiled css file
* `both`: Generates both the compiled css file and the minified file as well. Default Value.

**Important: This property replaces the formerly deprecated property `disableMinifiedFileGeneration` that is not used anymore.**

If you had earlier set `disableMinifiedFileGeneration` to be `true`, then you can set `outputFormat` to be `cssonly` to achieve the same effect.

If you had earlier set `disableMinifiedFileGeneration` to be `false` ( default value for the property ) , then you can set `outputFormat` to be `both` ( again , default value for the new property as well ).


## `dartsass.pauseInterval`
Default: 3. Pause Interval (in seconds) before kicking off another scss compilation to not compile frequently and hog resources.


## `dartsass.sassBinPath`

Default: Empty.

The watch functionality launches a `sass` command line process behind the scenes and delegates almost all of the watching functionality to the same.

`sassBinPath` references the location of the sass binary that needs to be launched when we *watch* a directory of input scss files for changes. 

Hence, you need to install sass binary locally or globally for the watch functionality to work.



 [ Use a recent sass version or a different relevant version for your use case as appropriate ]

### Linux

Sass Compiler can be installed locally as follows:

> `npm install -D sass@1.47.0`
 
After installation, you can set the property `dartsass.sassBinPath` to be one of the following as applicable.

> Set `dartsass.sassBinPath` to `node_modules/.bin/sass`


Aliter (global sass installation):

>  Sass Compiler can also be installed globally, as follows:
> `npm install -g sass@1.47.0`
> Determine the path to global sass compiler returned by `which sass`. ( say, `/usr/local/bin/sass` ).
> Set `dartsass.sassBinPath` to `/usr/local/bin/sass`.
> (assuming , that was the path returned by `which sass` run previously ).
> Having said that, we recommend local installation as mentioned above to prevent unnecessary quirks.



### Windows

Sass Compiler can be installed locally as 

> `npm install -D sass@1.47.0`

On Windows, the path to `sassBinPath` slightly differs because of a quirkiness [ See [Issue #24](https://github.com/codelios/vscode-dartsass/issues/24) ]

> Set `dartsass.sassBinPath` to `node_modules\\sass\\sass.js`.



## `dartsass.targetDirectory`
Default: Empty. The target directory to write the generated css files.

This can be an absolute directory or a directory, relative to project root.


# Deprecated Properties

## `dartsass.debug`

Default: false. Best applicable for **developers of this extension** only. If you are the end-user, feel free to ignore this altogether.

## `dartsass.disableMinifiedFileGeneration`
~~Default: False. Flag to disable minified file generation. Minified files are generated by default.~~

**The property is deprecated and not used. Refer to `dartsass.outputFormat` property described above for its replacement.**

# Removed Properties

##  `dartsass.autoPrefixBrowsersList`

~~Default: `["> 1%", "last 2 versions"]`. List of browsers to be specified for autoprefixer. See https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist#readme for more details.~~

**The property is removed since 0.9.0. 

# Menus

## DartSass: Sass Watch

  In the file explorer on the left hand side, when we right-click on a directory, we get a menuitem `DartSass: Sass Watch` .
  This option appears only in the case of a directory and not in case of individual files.


  This command `watches` the directory using the option `sass --watch input:output` .

  ```
  Important: For this menu / feature to work, the sassBinPath
  property must point to an external sass binary.
  Otherwise it will indicate an error.
  ```

  After the directory is successfully watched, an entry is added to the statusbar on the lower right bottom - `Sass Watchers: 1` (or any number as appropriate).

  When the IDE is closed the subprocesses launched for watching get killed automatically.

  To view the list of watched processes / directories, use the command: `DartSass: View Sass Watchers` and then check the `Output` under `DartJS Sass`.

  It will list all the watched source directories and the pid (tested in unix) for those processes.

## DartSass: Sass Unwatch

  In the file explorer on the left hand side, when we right-click on a directory, we get a menuitem `DartSass: Sass UnWatch` .
  This option appears only in the case of a directory and not in case of individual files.

  If a directory was watched before, this kills the process used to watch the directory.

  In case the directory was not watched before, a warning message appears indicating that no watcher exists for that directory.

# Commands

## QuikSass: Compile Current File

Compiles the current scss file in the active editor to .css and .min.css file as appropriate.

## QuikSass: Sass Compiler Version

Prints out the current sass compiler version being used.

## QuikSass: View Watcher List

Views the list of watchers by this sass plugin

## QuikSass: Clear All Watchers

Clears all existing sass watchers without trying to figure out all the existing watchers and unwatching them individually.
Useful in case we want to do a quick project watcher reset.

# Features

## Sass Watcher

This plugin has integrated functionality for sass watcher ( `sass --watch input:output`) in it.

## Pure Javascript SASS

This VSCode plugin directly depends on the native pure-javascript `sass` implementation.

Check [Dart implementation of SASS](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) for more details.

It does not depend on `node-sass` (or indirectly the platform-specific `libcss` either !).

## Customize Directory

By default, it looks for packages in `package.json` in the root directory of the current project. ( and hence, the packages in `node_modules`)

To customize the same, check `dartsass.sassWorkingDirectory`. More details below in extension settings.

# FAQ

 1. **Does this plugin come pre-built with Sass Compiler ?**

    Yes. by default - the plugin comes pre-built with one of the more recent releases of sass compiler. So - you would not need to install sass compiler locally in your system for the plugin to be active.

 1. **I already have Sass compiler installed in my system in PATH or would like to try a sass compiler installed in a specific path ? How can I configure the same ?**

    By default - the plugin uses the built-in sass compiler used internally. To use an external binary, see option `sassBinPath` mentioned above. Point `sassBinPath` to the binary (say, `/usr/local/bin/sass` ) in User / Workspace for vscode and then start saving the files. Now the plugin will use the external sass binary as opposed to the built-in sass library for the compilation.

 1. **I don't have a global sass installation / I don't have the write permission to write to the global files / I don't want to have a single global sass binary. What are my options to set `sassBinPath` now ?**

    In your project `package.json` , under `devDependencies`, add an entry for `sass` (version 1.47.0 , say)

    `
    "devDependencies": {
        "sass" : "1.47.0"
    }
    `

    Install the packages as `npm i --no-optional`

    Modify the property `dartsass:sassBinPath: "node_modules/.bin/sass"` at the workspace level ( and *not at the user level*). This can also be done through "File -> Settings -> search for "DartSass" under workspace tab".

    This should help install a local sass binary in your project under your project tree, and can be used for `watching` Sass directories, if you don't have a global sass installation.

1. **Can I use `node-sass` package in place of `sass` in step 3) above ?**

    The plugin has been written for `sass` package only and does not support `node-sass`. Not to mention , `node-sass` is platform dependent and deprecated as well. Hence we do not support the same.


1. **I have scss files that contain import statements that begin with "~" and used to work fine , until I had upgraded the plugin to v0.1.0+ ? What gives  ?**

    So earlier, we used to support the "~" prefix in import statements by using an importer called `node-sass-package-importer` . Hence it used to work.

    Starting from v0.1.0 though, support for `node-sass-package-importer` has been removed since then. So now your import statement becomes as follows.

    Earlier - `@import "~/bootstrap/scss/functions.scss"`

    would now be rewritten without the prefix "~/" as below:

    `@import "bootstrap/scss/functions.scss"`

    Also - you would want to set the `includePath` property (list of strings) as below:

    `"dartsass.includePath": ["node_modules"]`

    assuming the node_modules is in the root of the project under discussion. Else modify the above property accordingly.

    Changing the import statements and adding to `includePath` property should fix any changes broken by the upgrade.

    It is also better because eventually when the css files get packed /minified for distribution, they can be passed the conventional parameter `sass -I includeDir ..` to be compiled so avoiding any non-standard prefixes like **~** in the files helps that case.

 1. **The autocompile (of sass) files that comes predefined with the plugin is too aggressive and is killing the CPU. What can I do ?**

    By default, the Dart/JS compiler gets activated with every save of the current editor file.
If that is too aggressive, see `pauseInterval` configuration option above ( in seconds ). It can be used to configure the pause interval between successive compilations to use resources less aggressively.


 1. **I would like to use Autoprefixer for my compilation. Does this plugin support the same ?**

    The plugin comes built-in with autoprefixer support. See `autoPrefixBrowsersList` option to configure the browserslist for which autoprefixer needs to generate code (using postcss).

 1.  **I would like to compile a directory of .scss files everytime the files in the directory are changed. How do we do that ?**

     The plugin has an option called "Watch Directory" that goes with the context menu associated with a directory in the file explorer panel.

     This option launches a separate sass watch command in the background to implement the same.

1. **When I launch a "Watch Directory" , I get an error saying - "Directory watcher is not supported.". What could be going wrong ?**

   The directory watch functionality depends on the sass command line binary (platform-specific). So you need to install sass binary separately and then specify the binary using `sassBinPath` plugin configuration property ( See above ).

1. **I have watched a directory. Now I would like to unwatch the same and kill external processes that are watching as well.**

    Right click on a directory that is being watched already. Click "DartSass: Unwatch directory". This will `unwatch` the directory and kill the sass watch external process, if any.

    If the directory was not being watched , a warning message will popup indicating that the directory was not being previously watched.
